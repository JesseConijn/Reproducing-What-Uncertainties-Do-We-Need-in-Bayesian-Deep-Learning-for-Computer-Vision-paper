# What Uncertainties Do We Need in Bayesian Deep Learning for Computer Vision?

A repository meant for reproducing the results from the paper "What Uncertainties Do We Need in Bayesian Deep Learning for Computer Vision?".  

# Getting Started

For this project, the CamVid dataset was used to train the DenseNet model. To get access to this dataset, go to https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/carlolepelaars/camvid. In the script, change the input path to the appropriate path where the dataset can be found. Also change the output path for saving the images if needed.

The repository exists of 1 Jupyter Notebook:
- segmentation.ipynb
